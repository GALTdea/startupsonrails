The vision for Repeat came about after co-founders Kim Stiefel and Sarah Wissel launched their own direct-to-consumer apparel brand, UNDR.  What they found was that getting customers to commit to ongoing purchases was hard.  Most consumers don’t like the experience of re-ordering items and having subscriptions on a fixed schedule is equally frustrating.  So they decided that instead of forcing consumers to subscribe on a schedule, they would “nudge” customers to re-order during what they determined would would be the perfect window, based on data.  After experimenting with personalized reminders for their own brand, Stiefel and Wissel decided to pivot their startup so they could offer this service to any e-commerce CPG company and Repeat was born.","Los Angeles, CA",View Website,https://www.getrepeat.io,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Governments use PayIt to build a better customer experience for a wide range of digital transactions, from renewing a driver’s license to paying property tax. It’s more efficient for agencies, and more convenient for the people they serve.

***

We live in the age of convenience.

Almost anything we need is just a few clicks away.

But when it comes to government services, people still expect the worst: checks to write, forms to mail, lines to wait in, and clunky websites to navigate.

And it’s not just residents who are frustrated.

Agencies are saddled with an endless stream of paper to process, long lines and call center queues, and late payments that delay revenue collection.

That’s why agencies are turning to PayIt.

With 6 years on the GovTech 100, PayIt simplifies the way 80+ million residents do business with their local governments.

Agencies use PayIt to create the ideal user experience for a wide range of digital transactions, from renewing a driver’s license to paying property tax.

While residents enjoy more convenience, agencies cut their workloads by reducing the volume of paper forms, checks, in-person visits, and calls.

Delivering an average cost savings of $15 per transaction, PayIt has helped agencies get remarkable results like these:
- A 92% increase in online revenue collected year-over-year for the Kansas DMV
- A 50% reduction of walk-in customers for offices in Grand Rapids, Michigan
- A 25% reduction of manual checks processed for the average PayIt customer
